# 🧠 Introduction to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Welcome! 👋 This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to **RAG – Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, one of the most powerful patterns in modern AI.

## 🤖 What is RAG?

**RAG** stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It's a technique where an AI model doesn't just rely on what it was trained on – instead, it actively **retrieves** relevant information from documents (like PDFs, knowledge bases, or files), combines it with the user's question, and then **generates a more accurate response**.

Think of it like this:
> 🔍 Search first → 🧩 Combine with the question → 💬 Answer with real context.

This avoids "hallucinations" (made-up answers) and ensures the responses are **fact-based**, **contextual**, and **reliable**.

## 📌 What does this project do?

This project builds a mini-RAG system for a fictional insurance tech company called **Insurellm**. Here's what it does:

- Loads internal documents about employees and products 📂
- Matches a user's query with the relevant content 🔍
- Adds that content to the prompt ✨
- Sends it to a low-cost OpenAI model (`gpt-4o-mini`) for a response ⚡
- Uses **Gradio** to create a simple chatbot UI 💬

---

## 🎯 Why this is important

By building this, you're learning the **core mechanics of RAG** in a very lightweight way – no databases, no embeddings, just **file-based retrieval** and **prompt augmentation**.

You'll understand:
- How to combine local knowledge with LLMs 📘
- The value of giving models extra context ✍️
- How tools like Gradio can help you prototype AI ideas 🚀

This sets the foundation for more advanced RAG setups using **vector databases, embeddings, LangChain**, and more. 🛠️

> 🧠 **Summary (~150–200 words)**  
This is a beginner-level RAG project where we build a smart Q&A assistant for an insurance company using OpenAI and Gradio. Instead of training the model with all knowledge, we store information about employees and products in local files. When a user asks a question, we search for relevant documents, attach them to the query, and then send everything to the model. This way, the model can give more accurate, context-aware answers. It avoids guessing and only answers based on what it knows from the provided files. The goal is to help you learn how retrieval and generation work together. You’ll see how context improves AI answers, and why RAG is useful in real-world apps like internal chatbots, document search, and knowledge assistants. This small project gives you hands-on experience with the building blocks of RAG – and prepares you for more advanced systems that use vector databases and semantic search later on. 🚀
